								If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be curious.<br><br>
								Since I was little, I've wanted to understand how things work: 
								I mixed ingredients in my grandma's kitchen just to see what happened, 
								and I spent afternoons peering at water with a magnifying glass, 
								convinced I would find invisible organisms swimming around.<br><br>

								That same curiosity guided me through school.<br>
								Some people would have called me a nerd, and honestly, they wouldn't be wrong 🤓. 
								I've always been good at passing exams, even though studying itself wasn't my favorite activity. 
								I preferred practical subjects, hands-on learning, and anything that felt like solving a puzzle. 
								Science, especially math and physics, came naturally to me… though I also loved art class.<br><br>

								When it came time to choose a university degree, I felt completely lost. 
								It's funny how at 17 or 18 we're expected to make decisions that supposedly define our future.<br><br>

								I originally thought about studying mathematics, but I had the (very wrong!) idea that this 
								would only lead to teaching, which wasn't for me at that point. 
								So I chose Biochemistry… or at least that was the plan until I missed the admission cutoff by 0.008 points 🫠.<br><br>

								So I enrolled in Biology.<br><br>

								The first year was rough.
								I hadn't gotten into the degree I wanted, I had afternoon classes,
								I was leaving behind an environment where I had felt comfortable, 
								and, most importantly, I was facing a lot of change all at once. 
								Some people thrive socially at university; I wasn't one of them. 
								I felt like I was doing “3rd year of high school” all over again, not living some great new chapter.<br><br>

								I considered switching degrees, like a double major in maths and computer science.
								But changing my whole life again, felt overwhelming. 
								I told myself: “If I fail something, I'll switch.”
								But being who I am… I didn't fail.<br><br>

								So I kept going.<br><br>

								Things got better. In second year, I finally took Biochemistry, and funnily enough, 
								I didn't enjoy it at all. <br>
								That helped me feel much better about not having entered the degree in the first place.<br><br>

								Then came Bioinformatics, and everything clicked.<br><br>

								But even then, the path wasn't always smooth. I had professors tell my class:
								“I know biologists don't like numbers…”
								or
								“You've arrived late to bioinformatics.”<br>

								Comments like these can discourage people. 
								But I knew what I liked: numbers, logic, problem-solving... 
								so instead of letting those words limit me, they motivated me.<br><br>

								By the end of my Bachelor's, I was torn between Genetics and Bioinformatics. 
								I chose Genetics for my first Master's, and I learned a lot, especially while working in a lab with CRISPR.<br>
								I'd dreamed of doing a PhD since I was eight years old. 
								But dreams sometimes evolve.
								I didn't get the PhD position in that lab, and honestly, 
								at the time I interpreted it as a sign that maybe I wasn't meant for that path. 
								Looking back, I see it simply wasn't the right moment or the right project for me.<br><br>

								Finally, I decided to follow the path I had been circling for years and enrolled in a Bioinformatics Master's. 
								I loved it ❤️. The mix of biology and programming felt perfect. 
								The workload, the teamwork, and the “we're all in this together” feeling created bonds I still treasure.<br><br>

								During my Master's thesis, I worked in a synthetic biology lab where CRISPR became a constant in my daily life.<br>

								I ended up staying in that lab as a bioinformatics scientist, 
								which allowed me to work across many different projects and collaborate closely with wet-lab scientists. 
								One of the tools I contributed to, called INSERT-seq, began as a pipeline to detect chromosome rearrangements, 
								and we later adapted it to detect viral insertions relevant to a type of muscular dystrophy. 
								It eventually became part of the technology used by the lab's spin-off company.<br><br>

								It was an intense environment. Synthetic biology moves fast, and expectations are high, 
								but I learned a lot.<br><br>

								Over time, I realized something:<br>
								The moments when time flew were always the ones where I was programming. 
								I loved building analysis pipelines, especially for cutting-edge experimental designs that didn't 
								yet have standard tools. That creativity and problem-solving mindset was where I felt most alive.<br>

								So I started quietly searching for more programming-focused roles. 
								I only applied twice in two years. I wanted the “right” position.<br><br>

								The first one involved a live programming exam over Zoom, my first ever technical interview. 
								I was inexperienced, nervous, and… let's just say it didn't go well. I wasn't selected.<br><br>

								Months later, a second opportunity appeared: a position with nf-core, 
								an international open-source bioinformatics community built around the Nextflow ecosystem. 
								I had contributed before, loved the environment, and felt aligned with their mission. 
								The role was only for one year and based in Germany.<br>

								I had never lived abroad, but strangely, this time it felt right.
								And a few days after the interview, I got the email:
								“You've been selected.”<br><br>

								I was moving to Germany.<br><br>

								⏩ Almost 4 years after switching to a more technical role, I can say I've grown enormously: 
								technically, professionally, and personally.<br>
								Working in open source has shown me the value of collaboration, transparency, and community-driven science. 
								I've finally found a space where my love for biology and my passion for programming meet naturally.<br><br>

								I still care deeply about research and the biological questions behind the code, 
								but I also know that building tools, creating things that help others do their science, 
								is where I truly shine.<br><br>

								And if there's one thing I hope people take from my story, it's this:<br><br>

								👉 There is no such thing as “arriving late.”<br>
								👉 Your path doesn't need to look like anyone else's.<br>
								👉 Curiosity can take you very, very far.<br>

									When I was working as a Python teacher in the Python Programming for Bioinformatics subject, 
									from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), 
									one of the things that took the most time was correcting the assignments and giving useful feedback to students.<br>
									On the other hand, when I received the students feedback at the end of the subject, 
									each year I was seeing a high number of comments expressing happiness and gratefulness for the relevant feedback obtained.<br><br>

									Due to a lack of time and having other responsibilities,
									I had to pause my teaching.
									But some months after, an idea came to my mind:<br>
									If I could create a small program that can correct the student exercises and use LLMs to provide relevant feedback,
									this would allow me to teach again, being more productive, and ensuring that I give useful comments to everyone.<br><br>

									I decided to try to code an MVP, 
									and right after proving that it was working, I contacted the subject coordinator from the UOC.
									We had a meeting where I explained my idea, she shared some tools that they are already trying, 
									and we agreed that it would be good to try my tool!<br><br>

									Currently, we are in the process of doing the first tests with a real class,
									I hope that this will help both teacher and students, and it can become a useful tool for more people.<br><br>

									If you want to know more, please don't hesitate to contact me! ✉️

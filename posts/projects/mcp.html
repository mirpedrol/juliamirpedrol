									<p>LLMs and MCPs. From a fun hackathon project to a real scientific collaboration.</p>
								</header>

								<p>
									I was a bit skeptical about LLMs until I learnt about MCP servers, 
									which are basically collections of tools that LLMs can use to interact with the world,
									and avoid hallucination!<br><br>

									I was recommended to do <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/unit0/introduction">a course</a> about MCPs from Huggingface,
									and conveniently, right when I was finishing the course, 
									they organised an MCP hackathon!<br><br>

									With some colleagues from my lab we decided to join.
									Since I was working on a project where I want to tag all <a href="https://github.com/nf-core/modules">nf-core module</a> with <a href="https://edamontology.github.io/edam-browser/">EDAM ontologies</a>,
									we thought that this would be a very good task for an LLM agent,
									<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/asthara/agentontology">so we created it</a>!<br><br>

									We didn't have much time to dedicate to this,
									we decided to book three days to learn and experiment,
									and we ended up with a very nice product that was working better than just ChatGPT.<br>
									As it usually happens during hackathons, 
									having a team of people focused on a single project and collaborating together really boosts learning and making progress.
									[Side note: we did the submission wrong, otherwise I am sure we would have won 😂]<br><br>

									Some weeks later, during the 2025 ISMB/ECCB,
									we found out that a team of the Bioconductor and EDAM communities was working on a similar task,
									they wanted to tag Bioconductor packages with ontology terms.
									We talked and thought that it was a great opportunity for collaboration!
									And we created the <a href="https://github.com/edamontology/edammcp">edamMCP</a>.<br><br>

										<ul>
											<li>The original agent used some custom Python functions, and the <code>smolagents</code> library.</li>
											<li>The <code>edammcp</code> MCP uses <code>FastMCP</code> to build the server and other libraries
											such as <code>sentence-transformers</code> for concept embedding.</li>
											<li>Everything is open source 🔓</li>
											<li>This is still under development, reach out if you would like to participate!</li>
